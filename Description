The problem addressed in this project is the prediction of heart disease based on various clinical factors. Heart disease is a leading cause of mortality worldwide, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment. The dataset used for this task contains information about patients, including demographic features, medical test results, and lifestyle factors. Each instance in the dataset represents a patient, and the target variable indicates the presence or absence of heart disease.
